    Howdy, my name's Marcus. I like dogs, Poptarts and rap music.  My favorite PopTart is between
    the Oreo Creme and the Hot Fudge Sundae. The Oreo Creme is the same flavor as my favorite ice cream, but it's not as easy to get, which is why I like Hot Fudge Sundae. Hot Fudge Sundae was also my first Poptart, and it's easy accessability at the deli
    has kept it as one of my favorite Poptarts.

<div>Everyone is always confused on why 
    I include the first one sing as the other two have such different styles and honestly, it's just because I want to.
    When it comes to dogs, my favorite type is currently a shitzu because my grandma has one and I feel
    that me and him have some sort of connection with him and he's always so excited to see me.

  <td>When it comes to this course, I really look forward to learning more with Javascript, which I feel
  is my weakest point in the big three in code. It's also the only part of this course I don't look forward to
  because I feel like I might have to pay attention and listen a lot more.
